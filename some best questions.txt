Why do we need reference variables if we have pointers??

Pointer is a variable that holds memory address of another variable. 
Reference variable can be called as the  constant pointers that become de referenced implicitly.
 when we access the refernce it means we are accessing the storage.



so why do we need reference variable if we had pointers??????????????

in pointers to access the values of actual variable we need explicitly derefernce the pointer variable by using "value at address" dereferncing operator( *).
in refernce to access the value of the actual variable we do not need explicitly derefernce the reference variable, 
they get derefernced automatically.
